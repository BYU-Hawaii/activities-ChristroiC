            <h3>The Deep Sea</h3>
            <p> Why does the ocean sometimes look dark blue, sometimes light blue, other times more of a green or a brown color? To answer this question, we first need to understand why water typically appears blue in the first place.

                A simple diagram describing the selective reflectance of light from a pigment.
                Water isn't inherently blue; our eyes and brains interpret water as being blue because water molecules absorb reds, greens, oranges, and yellowsâ€”thus leaving only shorter-wavelength blues and violets unabsorbed to reflect back for our eyes to see. This effect is intensified with the ocean, because there's such a high concentration of water molecules reflecting blue wavelengths back at us.
                
                But why does the ocean appear to be dark blue in some places, turquoise in others, and sometimes (yuck) more of a brown color?
                
                Before researching this topic, I thought it was simply a matter of how deep the water was where I was looking: the darker the blue, the deeper the water. It turns out that I wasn't completely wrong, but there's a lot more to it than that.
                
                In very deep water, almost all of the sun's rays are absorbed by the water itself due to the lack of sediment and the lower amount of organic matter (like algae and jellyfish), and thus the blue appears to be darker.</p>
