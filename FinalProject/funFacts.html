                <li><i class="fas fa-globe"></i> <strong>Different Names:</strong> In the United Kingdom, Tic Tac Toe is commonly known as "Noughts and Crosses." In other parts of the world, it might also be called "X's and O's" or simply "Crosses and Circles."</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-users"></i> <strong>Universal Appeal:</strong> Tic Tac Toe is played worldwide and can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Its simplicity and accessibility make it a universal favorite.</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-desktop"></i> <strong>Early Computer Game:</strong> Tic Tac Toe was one of the first games to be programmed on a computer. In the 1950s, a computer named EDSAC at the University of Cambridge was used to play a version of Tic Tac Toe called "OXO."</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-calculator"></i> <strong>Mathematical Insights:</strong> There are 255,168 possible ways to play a game of Tic Tac Toe. However, considering rotations and reflections of the board, there are only 26,830 unique games. This makes it a great way to introduce basic combinatorics and symmetry.</li>
